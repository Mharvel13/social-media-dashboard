### What I learned

#### Introduction to React and Components

Learning React has been intresting and exciting and it's necessary to practice the concepts. The use of Components, Props and State was implemented in the course of this project.

I implemented the use ofconditional rendering in classnames to toogle the dark mode functionality.

```jsx
  <header className={`header  ${props.darkMode ? "dark-bg-top" : " "}`}>

```

At the end of it all, its a good practice project and useful in solidifying knowledge in React Concepts

### Continued development

This project can be developed to pull actual data from various social media accounts and useful in tracking activities and progress in these applications
It could be a project that incoperates backend technologies and API usage.
